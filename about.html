## About

I am a Plant Biologist working in diverse aspects of Tropical Biology. My current research is aimed at understanding the evolution of Crassulacean Acid Metabolism (CAM), a unique photosynthetic pathway, present in many epiphytic orchids. I employ a variety of techniques, from whole plant physiological measurements to phylogenetic analysis and genetic characterization, to ultimately understand how orchids evolve into such a successful plant group.
